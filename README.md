## Data Structures
### Array 
### Linked list
What is a linked list?
uses:  
struct/class :
memory spaces used:  
difference between Node and Node* :
arrary -> linked list  
traversal in linked list  
lenght of a linked list  
search an element in linked list

### Stack
### Queue
### Trees
Binary tree
- root
- children
- ancestor
- leaf nodes

5 types of trees  
1. full bt: every node has either has 2 or 0 children
2. complete bt: all levels completely filled except last level. 
                the last level has all nodes as left as possible
3. prefect: all leaf nodes are at same level
4. balanced: height of tree at max log(N)
5. degenerate: all nodes have one child
