### Notes

#### Linked List

####  Tree

Tree
- root
- children
- ancestor
- leaf nodes

5 types of trees  
1. full bt: every node has either has 2 or 0 children
2. complete bt: all levels completely filled except last level. 
                the last level has all nodes as left as possible
3. prefect: all leaf nodes are at same level
4. balanced: height of tree at max log(N)
5. degenerate: all nodes have one child
